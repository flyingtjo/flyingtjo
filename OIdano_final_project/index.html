      <p>According to data from the CDC, overdoses related to opioids have been on the rise for the past 23 years. Since 2016 though, the number of deaths involving the opioid “fentanyl” have increased at a faster rate than other drugs, and in 2021, fentynal was involved in more than half of all drug overdoses.</p>

      <p>In 2021, overdoses involving fentanyl made up more than 87% of opioid-related overdoses. Ten years ago, the numbers were considerably lower, with fentanyl only being found in approximately 12% of all opioid overdose deaths. </p>

      <p>Shane Lavigne, a task force officer for the Drug Enforcement Administration, says that the rise in fentanyl overdoses is directly related to heroin and other opioids that have been popular in the last 20 years. </p>

      <p>Fentanyl was first used medicinally in the 1960s as an alternative to common painkillers. It is 100 times more potent than morphine, thus allowing it to relieve pain that was too intense for other medications. The drug had been used in the medical field for many years without issue and had a significantly less presence on the street level compared with oxycontin and heroin. However, in 2013, deaths involving the drug began to skyrocket due to increased street usage.</p>

      <p>Heroin and Oxycontin were the most commonly sought after Opioids in 2013, and according to Lavigne, dealers were looking to increase their profits. They noticed that fentanyl is not only cheap to produce but highly potent as well. This led some dealers and illicit chemists to cut their products with fentanyl to “stretch the weight” of each load. Dealers would substitute portions of their product with fentanyl; by doing so, they’d be selling less of their pure product but at the same price.</p>

      <p>According to Lavigne, unlike fentanyl administered at a hospital, those producing the drug are calculatign dosage with profit in mind instead of safety. Dealers saw fentanyl as a way to increase return business by increasing the high felt by users and craving for more afterward. The increased use is dangerous, however, as the drug’s potency can make even a tiny amount potentially fatal. That fact doesn’t scare the drug dealers, though, “It’s all business to them,” according to Lavigne.</p>

      <p>By 2018, overdoses involving fentanyl had increased by 1000% and killed more yearly than any other opioid. Fentanyl use was spreading as well, and authorities found fentanyl in an increasing number of illicit substances beyond just opioids. In 2021, the DEA published a report about the dangers of “counterfeit pills”. Sellers on the black market advertised these pills as various prescription drugs, like Xannax, Adderall, or Oxycontin. In reality, these pills aren’t from a pharmaceutical company and can contain a lethal dose of fentanyl. While authorities do not know how many of these pills are on the market today, according to the DEA, 26% of the pills they’ve tested contained a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl or methamphetamine. </p>

    </div>
      
      <p>There’s more contributing to fentanyl’s growth than just the practice of dealers, though. According to CDC data, between 2016 and 2019, drug overdose deaths as a whole began to stabilize. In the years 2020 and 2021, however, fatal overdoses saw a significant spike in growth. According to Alexandra Punch, director of the Lerner Center for Public Health Promotion and Population Health, mental health issues illuminated by the pandemic lockdowns and lack of access to lifesaving resources may have led to an increase in overdoses overall.</p>

        Punch says that there are programs around the country looking to help decrease the number of fatal overdoses through the process of “harm reduction.” Harm reduction looks to mitigate the harmful effects that using drugs has on the user and the community. These programs can be anything from distributing clean injection equipment for preventing HIV to supplying communities with free Narcan, a medication that can reverse the effects of an overdose.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Punch, harm reduction can help save the lives of those who are drug users, and help them onto the path of recovery. Despite this though, there’s still a lot of social stigma revolving around harm reduction programs that are limiting funding.
      </p>

      <iframe title="How available is free Narcan in your state?" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-zekni" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zekni/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="535" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>

      <p>
      One example of this social stigma occurred on February 9th, 2022, when many groups criticized the Biden administration for funding what was believed at the time to be “crack pipes.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki later clarified that the Biden Administration designated the funding for harm reduction kits, including “Alcohol swabs, lip balm, and other materials to promote hygiene and reduce transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis.” Despite the correction, many people, including some lawmakers, spoke out against providing federal funding for harm reduction programs.
      </p>

      <p>
      Punch says that for harm reduction to be a viable solution for addiction, she feels that people need to let go of the idea that addiction is an issue of will and not chemical dependency, "You see people all over the internet saying things like: 'if cancer treatment isn't free then we shouldn't be giving out Narcan for free. People don't choose cancer, but people choose to use drugs'. There's this whole discourse around deservedness that makes programs like harm reduction harder for some people to accept".
